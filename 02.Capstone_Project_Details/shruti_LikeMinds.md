- Which problem Project is Solving?

  - After having completed 2 years of offline college I have realised the importance of having the right people around you. The people you surround yourself with really matters. But finding like-minded people in the college, who are as ambitious as you are, as compeititive as you are, having similar interests and learning patterns was a challenge. Therefore, I want to build a platform wherein students of similar domain of interests can come together, learn together, build together and ultimately grow together.
